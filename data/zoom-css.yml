  - "Content doesn't fit the screen."

  notes:
    - "Experiment with implementing `zoom` as a transform + transform-origin shorthand in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1589766."
    - "The experiment was disabled in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599324 due to breakage on sites that were using `zoom` together with `transform`."
    - "A console warning message about using `zoom` property was added in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582374."

  workarounds:
    - "Web Developers can use `transform: scale()` + `transform-origin: 0 0` instead of `zoom`."
