title: AAC audio decoding fails if there is no native codec
severity: low
user_base_impact: small

tags:
  - media

notes: |
  Due to patent issues, Firefox does not ship an AAC codec. Instead, it relies
  on the operating system to provide one. In certain circumstances, it's
  possible that the OS doesn't provide a codec, thus breaking AAC playback.

symptoms:
  - Issues with Audio or Video playback
  - Error messages claiming that a codec is not supported
