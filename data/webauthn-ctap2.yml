title: Missing support for CTAP2/FIDO2 in WebAuthn
tags:
  - webauthn

severity: high
user_base_impact: small

notes: |
  Even though this is affecting big properties, the issue is only affecting
  users who want to set up 2fa with a hardware token, and the assumption is that
  this is a relatively small subset of users, so the user_base_impact is small.

symptoms:
  - Users are unable to add a hardware security token to an account
  - Users are unable to use Windows Hello to sign into an account
