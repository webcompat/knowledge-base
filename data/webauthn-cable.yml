title: Missing support for caBLE in WebAuthn
tags:
  - webauthn

severity: high
user_base_impact: small

notes: |
  Even though this is affecting Google's sign in process, the issue is only
  affecting users who want to add their Android phone as a security hardware
  token, and the assumption is that this is a relatively small subset of users,
  so the user_base_impact is small.

symptoms:
  - Users are unable to use Google's "Built-in security key" on Android to sign into an account
